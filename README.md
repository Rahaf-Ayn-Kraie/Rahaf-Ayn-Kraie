# Hello there!

I'm Rahaf, a passionate and dedicated Web Developer 🎨, currently pursuing a diploma in Software Development at the Manitoba Institute of Trades & Technology (MITT). I am on track to graduate in August 2025. 🎓
- 🌎 I'm **based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada**. 🍁
-  🥅 My vision is to tell stories through my work—creating not just apps and websites, but meaningful experiences that resonate with people and bring them joy. I strive to craft projects that I can look back on with pride as works of art.

## About Me

🎓 **Education:** I am currently studying Software Development at the Manitoba Institute of Trades & Technology (MITT), where I’m gaining comprehensive skills in front-end and back-end development. This program equips me with the tools to excel in the ever-evolving tech industry.

🩺 **Diverse Experience:** Before transitioning to web development, I spent two years studying nursing and completed a six-month practicum in Lebanon. This experience taught me empathy, discipline, and attention to detail—qualities I now bring to my work as a developer.

🎒 **Ongoing Learning:** I am committed to continuous learning, whether it’s mastering new technologies, improving my coding skills, or engaging with the development community. Staying up-to-date in this rapidly evolving field is a priority as I strive to grow as a developer and make meaningful contributions.

📚  **Beyond Coding:** When I’m not coding, I immerse myself in novels, books, and anime. These hobbies inspire creativity and give me fresh perspectives that I bring to my projects.
